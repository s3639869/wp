        <div>Who is your tutor / instructor?</div>
        <div>Mr. Nguyen Minh Long</div>

        <div>Who is your labber?</div>
        <div>Mr. Nguyen Minh Long</div>

        <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
        <div>Yes I have. Well, I'd like to think so... I have taken a few introductory courses to other programming languages such as Python and Java. I have also...Googled, uhh I mean researched a bit on HTML and web programming in general before taking this class.</div>

        <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
        <div>I <em>would like</em> to be both if possible. Being able to work on both the back-end and front-end seems amazing. I think coding is a pretty cool job, but making things look beautiful feels good too.</div>

        <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
        <div>......It is...a mandatory course. But in all honesty, I would've taken it as an elective if possible anyway. I think Web Programming is a practical and interesting subject. The programming courses I took before were a bit...dry, they were mostly "Here's a problem, now write some codes logically to solve it", they lacked the freedom in creating and styling content that Web Programming has.</div>

        <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
        <div>Being able to create a fully functional and beautiful website.</div>

        <div>Assignments allow for individual or paired work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you
          like your assignment partner to have?</div>
        <div>I think my strengths are <i>being a good listener, doing research and expanding out ideas</i>. I would like my partner to be able to do research as well, because in the past I have worked with people who barely research anything by themselves, when met with a problem they just came to me or others for help. Teammates should help each other, but that doesn't mean when a problem arises you should just be dependent on others to solve it for you. I think we are born in the blessed era of technology, Google is free after all, so we should utilize it to help our learning.
          <br>
          Plus, I would love for my partner to be creative and be able to brainstorm various ideas. I can expand on existing ideas but I'm bad at coming with new ones. If the assignment asks to come up with something new and inventive I think I would have a hard time.
        </div>

        <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
        <div>I would say <b>Facebook</b> and <b>Youtube</b>. I think many people these days have <span
            title="Fear Of Missing Out">FOMO <sup>[?]</sup></span> and parhaps I do too, hence why I'm always checking Facebook. For
          Youtube, it's only a place for me to watch videos and listen to music. You may be wondering why I don't use
          the free (or paid) version of Spotify, I'm just not used to its interface and it doesn't seem as diverse as
          Youtube.
          <br>
          Recently I have started to use <b>Reddit</b> more too. It's a forum with a variety of topics up for discussion, ranging from scientific research to showbiz gossips. Sometimes I even search for simple explanations on certain topics in school by looking in the <span title="Explain Like I'm 5">ELI5 <sup>[?]</sup></span> section.
        </div>

        <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
        <div>Of course. I have general hobbies such as listening to music, watching movies, reading books and playing
          games.
          <br>
          I especially have an interest in the crime-solving and thriller genre. Did you know there's a Youtube channel
          called <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCftwRNsjfRo08xYE31tkiyw" target="_blank">WIRED</a></b> which has
          videos on interviews with real former FBI and CIA agents?
          <br>
          This doesn't mean I dislike happy and light stuff. I do watch romance such as <b>La La Land</b>, <b>Me Before You</b> and
          even the rom-com series <b>How I Met Your Mother</b> (<em>highly recommended!</em>). Basically the things I watch, read and
          play are <em>not</em> limited to only things I actually have an interest in.
